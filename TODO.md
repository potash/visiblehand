* Support more airlines: United, Southwest, Delta, etc.
* Cache fuel burn in route.fuel_burn
* Keep track of the undesirable approximations: fuel data for a different version of the aircraft (e.g. E145 vs E140), seating chart for different airline, etc.
* Add real tests
* Database stuff: create and share schema, fetch online data dynamically, save and share manually curated data by CSV
* Add usage guide to README
