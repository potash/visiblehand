* Cache fuel burn in route.fuel_burn
* Keep track of the undesirable approximations: fuel data for a different version of the aircraft (e.g. E145 vs E140), seating chart for different airline, etc.
* More tests
* Database stuff: programatically fetch, parse and import data from sources
* Utility receipts: gas and electric, use EPA and EIA datasets to estimate carbon emissions
